## üîß Configuration Details

### Firebase Services Setup

1. **Firestore Rules** (for development):
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Storage Rules** (for development):
   ```javascript
   rules_version = '2';
   service firebase.storage {
     match /b/{bucket}/o {
       match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read, write: if true;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Required Permissions

The app requires the following device permissions:
- **Camera**: For taking photos
- **Photo Library**: For selecting existing images  
- **Location**: For sharing current location
- **Microphone**: For recording audio messages

Permissions are requested automatically when features are used.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Expo Go keeps stopping"**
   - Ensure WiFi is enabled on your device/emulator
   - Try restarting the Expo development server

2. **Firebase Storage upload errors**
   - Verify Firebase Storage is enabled in your Firebase Console
   - Check that Storage rules allow read/write access
   - Ensure correct Firebase configuration in App.js

3. **Images not loading**
   - Check internet connection
   - Verify Firebase Storage rules and permissions
   - Review console logs for specific error messages

4. **Location not working**
   - Grant location permissions when prompted
   - Ensure device GPS is enabled
   - Test on physical device (location may not work on some emulators)

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console logs for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure Firebase services are properly configured
4. Test on a different device or emulator

## üöÄ Deployment

### Building for Production

1. **Create Expo Build**:
   ```bash
   expo build:android
   # or
   expo build:ios
   ```

2. **Update Firebase Rules** for production:
   - Implement proper authentication-based rules
   - Remove test mode configurations
